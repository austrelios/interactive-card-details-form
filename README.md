Frontend Mentor projects - Interactive Card Details Form challenge

This is one of the challenges from Frontend Mentor. It's a junior level challenge that requires the following skills:
 - allow the user to input card details that are then displayed in another section of the page in real-time
 - show error messages if the user enters invalid card number, expiry date or CVC, or leaves a field blank
 - implement a submit and continue button that navigates to another view
 - is responsive to the screen size
 - changes the state of the button when the cursor hovers over it

I had a lot of difficulty aligning the card images, especially one of the cards that overlaps on two div elements.
